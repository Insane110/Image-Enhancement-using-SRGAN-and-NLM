# Image-Enhancement-using-SRGAN-and-NLM
In this project I have used deep learning algorithm SRGAN(Super Resolution Generative Advesarial  Network) for image reconstruction and for enhancing the quality i have used denoising technique such as NLM(Non-Linear Means).I have saved model checkpoints and architecture so that when loading the model we donot have to again runback the whole code.
